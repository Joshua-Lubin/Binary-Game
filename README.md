# Binary-Game
I completed this project as an honors contract for CSE 205.

## Functionality
- Be re-playable without closing the application and starting it again
- Accurately convert base 10 numbers to binary
- Give the user a score when they are done
- End the game when the user runs out of time
- Include a timing bar so the user can visualize the amount of time left
- Add extra time for each number the user accurately converts to binar

The logo fades in and text that says, "Press any button to begin," fades in and out. When the user clicks their mouse or keyboard, the screen fades away and the menu appears.

In the menu, the user can choose the number of bits in each number, how much time is added to the clock if they get a number correct, and whether the time added decreases as the game progresses.
